# Roman to Nepali Unicode Converter

A Chrome extension that converts Romanized Nepali text to Nepali Unicode in real-time.

## Algorithm Overview

The converter uses a sophisticated mapping system to transform Romanized Nepali text into Nepali Unicode. Here's how it works:

### 1. Character Mapping System

The core of the conversion process relies on a comprehensive mapping system that includes:

- **Base Characters**: Maps individual Roman letters to their Nepali Unicode equivalents
- **Combined Characters**: Handles complex combinations of letters to form Nepali characters
- **Special Cases**: Manages unique Nepali characters and their variations

### 2. Conversion Process

The conversion follows these steps:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Takes Romanized Nepali text as input
   - Processes the text character by character
   - Maintains context for proper character combination

2. **Character Mapping**:
   - Uses a lookup table to map Roman characters to Nepali Unicode
   - Handles both single characters and character combinations
   - Supports all Nepali characters including:
     - Vowels (‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞)
     - Consonants (‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§û‡•ç‡§ú‡§®)
     - Matras (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ)
     - Special characters

3. **Context-Aware Conversion**:
   - Considers surrounding characters for proper conversion
   - Handles special cases like:
     - Half letters
     - Combined characters
     - Special Nepali characters

### 3. Special Features

The converter includes special handling for:

- **Half Letters**: Proper conversion of half letters (‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§∞)
- **Matras**: Correct placement of matras (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ)
- **Combined Characters**: Accurate handling of combined characters
- **Special Characters**: Support for unique Nepali characters

### 4. Technical Implementation

The conversion is implemented using:

- A compressed mapping table for efficient storage
- Optimized lookup algorithms for fast conversion
- Real-time processing for immediate feedback
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Usage

1. Type or paste Romanized Nepali text in the input field
2. The text will be automatically converted to Nepali Unicode
3. Use the copy button to copy the converted text
4. The conversion happens in real-time as you type
